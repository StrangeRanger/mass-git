*Demo: Quickly update all git repositories in a directory tree with a single command. The video shows recursive search, dry-run, and pull options in action.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bash (v4+ recommended)
- Git (v2+ recommended)
- Unix-like OS (Linux, macOS, BSD, WSL, etc.)

### Download and Setup

You can run Mass Git immediately in your current directory or install it globally for convenience:

#### 1. Quick Start (Run Directly)

Download and run the script in your current directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeRanger/mass-git/refs/heads/main/mass-git
chmod +x mass-git
./mass-git
```

#### 2. Install Globally (Recommended)

To use Mass Git from anywhere, install it to your local bin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StrangeRanger/mass-git
cd mass-git
./setup.bash
```

After installation, you can run `mass-git` from any directory.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, `setup.bash` creates a hard link in `~/.local/bin`. To use a symbolic link instead, set `C_USE_HARD_LINK=false` in the script.

## Uninstallation

To remove the script, simply delete the `mass-git` file from your system. If you used `setup.bash`, remove the link from `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
rm ~/.local/bin/mass-git
```

If you cloned the repository, you can also delete the `mass-git` directory:

```bash
rm -rf <path_to_mass_git_directory>
```

## Usage

```man
‚ùØ mass-git -h
Fetch or pull one or more git repositories at a specified location on your
system.

Usage: mass-git [-r] [-f] [-d] <path>
       mass-git -h
       mass-git -v

Options:
  -h, --help      : Displays this help message.
  -r, --recursive : Recursively locate git repositories.
  -f, --fetch     : Fetch instead of pull from git repository.
  -d, --dry-run   : Show what would be done, without making any changes.
  -v, --version   : Display program version number.
```

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: I get a 'Permission denied' error when running the script.</strong></summary>

A: Make sure the script is executable: <code>chmod +x mass-git</code>.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: The script is not found after running setup.</strong></summary>

A: Ensure <code>~/.local/bin</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code>. You can add it to your shell profile:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Does this work on Windows?</strong></summary>

A: Not natively, but it should work in WSL or other Unix-like environments.
